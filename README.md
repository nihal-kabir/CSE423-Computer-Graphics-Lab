## Overview

Twin Invaders is a 2D space shooter game developed as part of the CSE423 Computer Graphics Lab course. The game features classic arcade-style gameplay where players control a spacecraft to eliminate alien invaders while managing limited lives and achieving high scores.

## Features

- **Classic Arcade Gameplay**: Navigate and shoot in a retro-style space shooter environment
- **Dynamic Enemy**: Aliens move horizontally and fire projectiles at the player
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Multiple bullet patterns and increasing challenge levels
- **Life System**: Three lives with visual heart indicators
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time score display based on alien eliminations
- **Game State Management**: Play, pause, restart, and exit functionality
- **Smooth Graphics**: OpenGL-rendered graphics with fluid animations
- **Responsive Controls**: Keyboard and mouse input support

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenGL support
- Windows/Linux/macOS compatible

### Required Python Packages

- PyOpenGL
- PyOpenGL_accelerate

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nihal-kabir/CSE423-Computer-Graphics-Lab.git
   cd CSE423-Computer-Graphics-Lab
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
   ```

4. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   python 423_project.py
   ```

## How to Play

The objective is to eliminate all alien invaders while avoiding their projectiles. You control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen and must survive waves of alien attacks.

### Game Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Left Arrow | Move spacecraft left |
| Right Arrow | Move spacecraft right |
| Spacebar | Fire bullets |
| P Key | Pause/Resume game |
| Mouse Click | Interact with UI elements |

### Game Mechanics

- **Lives**: Start with 3 lives (displayed as hearts)
- **Scoring**: Gain points by destroying alien invaders
- **Weapons**: Multiple bullet patterns unlock as you progress
- **Enemy Behavior**: Aliens move horizontally and shoot downward
- **Collision Detection**: Bullets and spacecraft interact with enemies and obstacles

## Technical Implementation

### Graphics Engine
- **OpenGL**: Hardware-accelerated 2D graphics rendering
- **GLUT**: Window management and input handling
- **Custom Rendering**: Hand-coded geometric shapes and animations

### Key Components

- **Renderer**: OpenGL-based drawing functions for all game objects
- **Physics Engine**: Collision detection and movement calculations
- **Game State Manager**: Handles play/pause/restart/exit states
- **Input Handler**: Keyboard and mouse event processing
- **Animation System**: Smooth object movement and visual effects

### Code Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Separate functions for different game components
- **Global State Management**: Efficient variable handling for game state
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Responsive input and animation loops
- **Real-time Rendering**: Continuous screen updates for smooth gameplay
