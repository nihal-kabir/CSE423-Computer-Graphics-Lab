# Diamond Frenzy

A 2D arcade-style game built using OpenGL and Python where players catch falling diamonds to score points.

## Description

Diamond Frenzy is an interactive graphics game developed as part of CSE423 Computer Graphics Lab. The game features smooth animations, collision detection, and progressively increasing difficulty. Players control a catcher to collect colorful diamonds falling from the sky while avoiding game-ending misses.

- Progressive difficulty scaling with score
- Smooth OpenGL-rendered graphics using Bresenham's line algorithm
- Interactive game controls (play, pause, restart)
- Dynamic color generation for diamonds
- Collision detection system
- Score tracking and display

## Technical Implementation

### Graphics Rendering
- Custom implementation of Bresenham's line drawing algorithm
- Zone-based coordinate conversion for optimal line rendering
- OpenGL point and line primitives for shape construction
- Double buffering for smooth animation

### Game Mechanics
- Physics-based diamond falling animation
- Boundary collision detection
- Real-time input handling for player movement
- Game state management (playing, paused, game over)

### Libraries Used
- **PyOpenGL**: OpenGL bindings for Python
- **PyOpenGL_accelerate**: Performance optimization for OpenGL operations
- **random**: Random number generation for diamond positioning and colors

## Gameplay

1. **Objective**: Catch falling diamonds with your catcher to earn points
2. **Scoring**: Each successfully caught diamond increases your score by 1
3. **Difficulty**: Game speed increases with each point scored
4. **Game Over**: Missing a diamond (letting it fall past the bottom) ends the game
5. **Features**: 
   - Diamonds appear in random colors and positions
   - Catcher movement is constrained within game boundaries
   - Real-time score display in console
